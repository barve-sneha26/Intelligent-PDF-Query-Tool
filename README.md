# AI-Powered PDF Query Application (Intelligent PDF Query Tool)

## üìñ Overview
The **AI-Powered PDF Query Application** enables users to upload PDF files, extract content, and query them interactively. Using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques, the application retrieves relevant document sections and generates concise, context-aware responses. This project combines the power of semantic search, natural language processing, and generative AI to simplify document analysis and provide actionable insights.



## ‚ú® Features
- **Interactive PDF Querying**: Upload PDFs and query their content in real-time.
- **Semantic Search**: Uses Hugging Face embeddings and FAISS for efficient document retrieval.
- **Generative AI Responses**: Leverages Hugging Face's `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model for generating natural language answers.
- **Text Chunking**: Handles long documents by splitting them into manageable chunks for better processing.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive user experience.



## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **LangChain**: Workflow orchestration for RAG.
- **Hugging Face**: Pre-trained models for embeddings and summarization.
- **FAISS**: Vector store for efficient similarity search.
- **Streamlit**: Web-based application interface.
- **PyPDF2**: Extracts text from PDF documents.
- **Python**: Backend logic and integration.



## üß© Methodologies and Approach
1. **Document Upload and Text Extraction**:
   - Users upload a PDF file via the application interface.
   - Text is extracted from the PDF using `PyPDF2`.

2. **Text Splitting**:
   - Extracted text is divided into smaller, manageable chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.

3. **Embedding Generation and Vector Storage**:
   - Text chunks are converted into embeddings using Hugging Face's `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model.
   - FAISS stores these embeddings, enabling fast semantic search.

4. **Query Processing and Response Generation**:
   - Users input queries about the PDF content.
   - Relevant chunks are retrieved from FAISS based on query similarity.
   - The `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model generates concise, natural language responses.

5. **Interactive User Interface**:
   - The entire workflow is presented via a Streamlit interface for seamless user interaction.



## üéØ Project Goals
- **Simplify Document Analysis**:
  - Enable users to extract insights from complex PDFs effortlessly.
- **Enhance Information Retrieval**:
  - Provide precise and context-aware answers based on user queries.
- **Democratize AI for Knowledge Access**:
  - Make advanced NLP technologies accessible through an intuitive interface.



## üåç Business Impact
1. **Improved Productivity**:
   - Saves time by summarizing lengthy documents into concise answers.
   - Allows professionals to focus on actionable insights rather than manual review.

2. **Enhanced Decision-Making**:
   - Provides accurate responses to specific queries, reducing ambiguity in document analysis.

3. **Wider Accessibility**:
   - Makes advanced AI tools usable for non-technical audiences, fostering wider adoption in industries like law, education, and research.

4. **Versatile Applications**:
   - Suitable for various domains, including:
     - Legal document review
     - Research paper analysis
     - Business report summaries



## üèÅ Conclusion
The **AI-Powered PDF Query Application** demonstrates the potential of combining **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with modern NLP techniques to tackle real-world challenges. By leveraging semantic search and generative AI, it streamlines the process of extracting insights from complex documents. This project is a stepping stone toward democratizing access to AI-powered tools for document analysis, with the potential to scale across diverse industries and use cases.
